NAME
    loganalyzer : analyse EZproxy log file

SYNOPSIS
        cat somelogfiles | loganalyzer.pl

DESCRIPTION
    Takes as input log file(s) from EZproxy, and produces an Excel file,
    with separate worksheets giving a summary of user page requests by
    statistical category, department (staff), and course (students)
    respectively.

    The login is the user name used to log in to EZproxy. A user may have
    more than one identifier for login.

    The user id is the internal Alma id of the user.

    As each log file line is processed, the user login is mapped to the
    associated statistical category/dept/program code for that user, and
    then a count taken of page requests for the given domain and code. The
    byte count for requests is also accumulated for each stat code.

    At the end of processing, an Excel file is output consisting of

        domain page requests by statistical category
        domain bytes by statistical category
        domain page requests by staff department code
        domain page requests by student program (course) code

    Processing ignores input lines for image, javascript, and css files, and
    also lines with zero bytes, so the page count is a more accurate
    reflection of actual "pages" read. Although this is not absolutely
    accurate.

FILES
    *   user-login.map maps the user login to their (Alma) primary
        identifier

    *   user-stat.map maps each user to a statistical category code

    *   user-dept.map maps each user to their department code (staff)

    *   user-program.map maps each user to their program or course code
        (students)

    *   Categories.dat provides a descriptive label for each stat code

    *   Departments.dat provides a descriptive label for each department
        code

    *   Programs.dat provides a descriptive label for each program code

    *   configured-hosts.txt lists all the EZproxy configured hosts, with
        the Title for each. This makes the list of resources more
        meaningful.
